## Auto mobilised wheel chair with fall detectioN
Our solution provides a better life to a lot many people in the whole world who cannot walk on their own and need continuous monitoring.

We have built an Auto mobilised wheel chair with fall detection, which can help the patients move with their slightest of finger movements and it can also intimate the kin and friends incase of any emergency or if the patient tumbles from the wheel chair.

The code is written in a modular way i.e., it is divided into functions for better understanding and documentation purpose.
The program **completely works from the X and Y co-ordinate values from the IoT device.**
The wheelchair moves in all the four directions depending on the controlled movement of the user, which is going to send specified values which are dynamically taken into the program.
There is also a special function for "stop".
